```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <p class="text-lg font-bold">Some text here</p>
</div>
```

This code *might* work correctly, but it can lead to unexpected behavior or styling issues if you don't pay close attention to Tailwind's class precedence and specificity rules. The problem arises when you have conflicting or overlapping styles applied to an element.
