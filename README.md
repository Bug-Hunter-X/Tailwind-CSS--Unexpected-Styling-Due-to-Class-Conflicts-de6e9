# Tailwind CSS Class Conflict Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: unexpected styling results due to class precedence and specificity conflicts.  The bug showcases how seemingly correct Tailwind classes can interact in unexpected ways. The solution provides strategies for resolving these conflicts and improving the maintainability of your Tailwind CSS code.

## Bug Description

The bug arises from using multiple Tailwind CSS classes on a single element without fully understanding how Tailwind handles style conflicts. Sometimes, more specific or later-defined classes can override intended styles, resulting in unexpected visual output.

## Solution

The solution focuses on the following strategies:

* **Understanding specificity:** Learning how Tailwind resolves style conflicts based on class specificity.
* **Using `!important` (sparingly):**  Forcing a specific style to override others in exceptional cases (use cautiously).
* **Refactoring classes:**  Optimizing class names and structure for better clarity and avoiding conflicts.
* **Using Tailwind's utility-first approach effectively:** Avoid unnecessary complexity.
